## 📖 How Cross-Device File Sync Works- **Complete offline backup** - export all data + files

### Technical Architecture- **Individual file downloads** - access any stored file- **Visual calendar** with post counts and scheduling

```javascript

// Automatic file sync when devices connect### 📅 Social Media Tools- **File attachments** for images and videos- **Vanilla JavaScript** - No framework bloat

peer.on('connection', (conn) => {

  // After data sync, check for missing files- **Visual calendar** with post counts and scheduling

  setTimeout(() => {

    requestMissingFiles(conn) // "What files do you have?"- **File attachments** for images and videos- **Instagram schedule helper** - pre-populates 11 strategic posts- **PeerJS** - WebRTC for P2P real-time sync

  }, 2000)

})- **Instagram schedule helper** - pre-populates 11 strategic posts



// Handle file sharing requests- **Separate captions** - write detailed post content- **Separate captions** - write detailed post content- **localStorage** - Offline persistence

conn.on('data', (message) => {

  if (message.type === 'file-request') {## 🎯 Offline Workflow Example- **GitHub Pages** - Free static hosting

    // Send files the other device doesn't have

    sendMissingFiles(message.theirFiles, conn)### Working Offline## 🚀 Quick Start- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first styling

  } else if (message.type === 'file-data') {

    // Receive and save file from other device1. **Lose internet connection** → App continues working normally

    saveReceivedFile(message.file)

  }2. **Make changes** → Tasks, lineup updates, new social posts### Option 1: Use Live Version## � Development

})

```3. **See pending indicator** → "📝 3 pending syncs" appears in header



### File Transfer Process4. **Click "View"** → See exactly what changed while offline1. Go to **[https://taylordrew4u2.github.io/produce/](https://taylordrew4u2.github.io/produce/)**

1. **Device A connects** → Sends list of files it has

2. **Device B compares** → Identifies missing files### Coming Back Online2. Share the URL with your team```bash

3. **Device B requests** → "Send me files X, Y, Z"

4. **Device A sends** → Transfers actual file data via WebRTC1. **Reconnect to internet** → App detects connection

5. **Device B saves** → Files appear in IndexedDB and UI updates

2. **Join team room** → Other contributors connect3. Start collaborating instantly!# Generate PWA icons (optional)

### Storage Architecture

```3. **Auto-sync** → All offline changes broadcast automatically

2. **Copy URL** → Note the full URL (includes room code)

3. **On computer** → Open the exact same URL### Real-Time Sync + Offline Detectioncd produce```

4. **Upload test file** → Try uploading a photo on phone

5. **Watch magic** → File appears on computer automatically!- **PeerJS WebRTC** handles peer-to-peer connections

### Option 2: Team File Sharing- **Automatic offline detection** using `navigator.onLine` + connection count

1. **Share URL** → Send the same link to all team members

2. **Everyone connects** → All devices join the same room- **Change tracking** stores what changed while disconnected

3. **Upload anywhere** → Files uploaded by anyone appear for everyone

4. **Manual sync** → Click "Sync Files with Team" if needed- **Smart sync** broadcasts pending changes when reconnected# Serve the single HTML fileGitHub Actions automatically deploys `index.html` to GitHub Pages.

## 💾 Cross-Device File Management### Offline Change Detectionpython3 -m http.server 8080

### 🔄 Automatic Sync (Recommended)```javascript

- **Happens automatically** when devices connect

- **No user action needed** - files just appear// Track changes when offline or no peers connected# OR use any web server (nginx, Apache, etc.)## 🔒 Privacy

- **Background process** - doesn't interrupt workflow

- **Smart detection** - only transfers missing filesfunction trackOfflineChange(type, itemId) {

### 🎛️ Manual Sync Controls  if (!isOnline || connections.length === 0) {

1. **"Sync Files with Team"** → Force immediate sync check

2. **Status indicators** → See transfer progress in real-time      offlineChanges[changeKey] = {

3. **Individual download** → Save specific files locally

4. **Bulk export** → Download all files as backup      type: 'tasks',# Open in browserAll data stays in your browser's localStorage. P2P sync uses WebRTC relay servers only for connection establishment - no data is stored on servers.

### 📱 Mobile-Specific Tips      itemId: '123'

1. **Upload immediately** → Don't wait - files sync in background

2. **Use camera button** → Quick photo uploads from mobile camera      timestamp: Date.now(),open <http://localhost:8080>

3. **Check sync status** → Look for transfer indicators in header

4. **Keep app open** → Sync works best when app stays active      description: 'Updated task 123'
